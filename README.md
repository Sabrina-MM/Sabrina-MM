- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sabrina-MM, I'm a Junior front end developer, in the early stages of my career, who is comfortable working with React.js, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I'm originally from Argentina, but based in London. I have always been curious about coding, and finally found the time to start learning. Since then, I haven't stopped, and have discovered how genuinely enjoyable coding is for me.
- 💞️ I love coding.
