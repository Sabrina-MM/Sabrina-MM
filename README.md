- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sabrina-MM, I'm beginning front-end developer based in London. I've always been curious about web design and development,  but I had not have right time to start learning, so I decided to start with this new coding journey and learn more about it.
- Since I started I can not stop learning, and I have discovered how enjoyable coding is for me. I'd like to be part of a team and contribute to big projects in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React projects.
